Some tones and scripts for composing in 19 Tone-Equal-Temperament 19TET/19EDO
A is tuned flat so that midde A is 437.36HZ, this was done because I wanted it to share a G with 440hz 12TET.

I did have a couple of small errors in the earlier pluck, they still sound nice so I've left them there and uploaded some new ones.
